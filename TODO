# DESIGN RULES 
- only 3 levels, not deeper 
- use static methods over normal methods
- just a namespace with functions? still expose it like an object, for easy js <--> rust translation
- break all these rules rather than doing something really stupid


# At Javascript 
- Widgets 
- Types & basic type conversion
-
